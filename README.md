# Advanced-Brain-Coverage

This repository contains code adapted from the DCAN-Labs `brain_coverage` project:
- Upstream source: https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/brain_coverage

Modifications in this repository include:
- Configuration-driven paths (CONFIG dictionary) for dataset-specific deployment
- DWI brain coverage computation using subject-specific ACPC-space masks
- Output formatting tailored to `participant_id` and a single DWI coverage metric
